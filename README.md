# Shigger
A simple shitty digger in CC Tweaked using Advanced Peripherals Geo scanner to mine everything from surface to bedrock, designed especially for All the Mods 10 modpack.

It was coded in around 5 days while I didn't have access to Minecraft and then tested and debugged in one day. It still has some bugs and I will have to make some improvements, so this is NOT the final version and should be used on your own risk.
